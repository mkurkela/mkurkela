An average Finnish male is an engineer and his wife works in healthcare
sector. Average Finnish male drives a wagon and do sports at least twice a week.
Most popular sports are jogging, skiing or cycling. So I quess I am pretty
average guy.

My name is Mikko Kurkela and I come from Finland. More precisly from
Rovaniemi, the home of Santa Claus. I am 25 years old computer geek who likes to
do sports, read non-fiction books, play MMO computer games and enjoy good
food.

I am recently graduated (Bachelor of Engineering) software developer from
<a href="http://www.ramk.fi/fi.iw3">Rovaniemi University of Applied
Sciences</a>. At the moment I am working in Raute as software engineer.

At free time I do sports. On junior series I used to compete on individual
endurance sports like cross-country skiing, orienteering and ski-orienteering.
Recently I haven't been competing except in orienteering but not that serious as
in past. Still sports has important part of my life. Aikido has became my main
activity. At winter I enjoy telemark skiing.

I am a person who get excited on many things. Unluckily it is not possible to
do everything...
