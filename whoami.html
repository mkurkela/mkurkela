title: Who am I
---

<p>An average Finnish male is an engineer and his wife works in healthcare
sector. Average Finnish male drives a wagon and do sports at least twice a week.
Most popular sports are jogging, skiing or cycling. So I quess I am pretty
average guy.</p>

<p>My name is Mikko Kurkela and I come from Finland. More precisly from
Rovaniemi, the home of Santa Claus. I am 25 years old computer geek who likes to
do sports, read non-fiction books, play MMO computer games and enjoy good
food.</p>

<p>I am recently graduated (Bachelor of Engineering) software developer from
Rovaniemi University of Applied Sciences. At the moment I am working in CERN,
the European Organization for Nuclear research in Geneve. I am coding a profiler
software called IgProf, which is used to reduce resource hunger of the software
used in CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) project. The CMS is one of the detectors in
the Large Hadron Collider. Sounds cool!</p>

<p>At free time I do sports. On junior series I used to compete on individual
endurance sports like cross-country skiing, orienteering and ski-orienteering.
Recently I haven't been competing except in orienteering but not that serious as
in past. Still sports has important part of my life. Sometime ago I started to do
snowboarding again and got my fianc√©e hooked on it also. Last winter I finally
got pair of telemark skis and can't wait for next winter. Luckily there is
activites in summer too like cycling and hiking. And orienteering of course.</p>

<p>I am a person who get excited on many things. Unluckily it is not possible to
do everything...</p>
