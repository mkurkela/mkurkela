title: New challenges in Kajaani
---

It has been a while since my last post. Last time I wrote about seeking a job.
Not anymore as I was lucky to get one. Since the begin of August I have been
working in Mecano, which is part of Raute Oy, in Kajaani. Kajaani is a very small city in
the middle of nowhere. And thats one reason I wanted to go there. I also had
interview invites to some companies in Helsinki and Tampere but Kajaani felt
much better option for me. In Mecano I am going to work with analysing devices
that are used in veneer production mills, like camera systems and RF moisture
meters.

I have learned many new things, mostly related to veneer production, and of
course all companies has their own way to do stuff. But I am not going to write
about that now. I want to talk about Qt. There exist many nice IDEs but
Qt is now my favourite. I have had Qt on my computer for long time but I
never really used it. At school we used mostly Visual Studio, Eclipse and
netbeans. In CERN, just VIM text editor with omnifuntion was enough. I learned
basics of using VIM in CERN so since that I have been writing almost all my text
with it. In Qt-creator you can set fake vim, which allows you to edit text like
with vim.

Even the fake vim option is nice, the best thing in Qt is the programming
interface and the Qt-help and also the multiplatform support. Most of the code
work out-of-box on Linux, which I usually use, and on Windows. Qt-programming
interface is quite easy to learn and once you are in trouble you can just press
F1 and the Qt-help opens. You can also easily generate your own help pages with
doxygen. (That is also possible for Eclipse) I found it very convinient to have
help pages generated from code, that you or your team mate wrote.
