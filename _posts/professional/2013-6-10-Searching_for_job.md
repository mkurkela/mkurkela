title: Searching for Job
---

As a recent graduate it is not always easy to find a job. Most software engineer
places requires good amount of experience, which most of us fresh engineers do
not have. Luckily enough, I have some international experience, which seems to
be good value when searching a job. It makes me little different than most of
the engineers at the begin of their career and I already got some job interview 
invites even I really have not started my job seeking. So far, I have only been browsing some
LinkedIn job advertisements while reading interesting articles and sent couple
of applications when I saw something very interesting.

Last week, I had an interview. Actually it was, the first job interview I have
ever had. The job was embedded software developement place in a medium size
company in Finland. The problem was that my studies were not dealing with
embedded systems very much. I was not as confident as I would have been in other
circumstances. After all the interview went kinda ok but there were couple of
questions where felt that I failed. After the inteview I felt that I was not
able to describe my skills and my personal charasteristics in the best possible
way.

After the interview, I read few articles how to be succesfull in job interviews.
Most of the articles were not helping much but what I learned is that I got to
be more aware of my strengths, weaknesses and got to have an clear aim what I
want to do in future. Be more aware about myself. Everybody has an idea about
themselves but how true the image of yourself actually is. I know that I learn
things fast, and also got some evidences on that. I am not the most talkative
person if I do not feel confident. For example in the case of the interview.
Definetly one of my weakness. The last thing, what do I want to become. I want
to improve everything. Make the processes better. I want to lead a group of
experts and help them to get the most out of their abilities.

The image about me in my mind may be wrong. So I decided to start actively
think how I am performing in different kind of tasks and situations. First step to learn is to
realize the facts. The results of the new habit will not help me much in the
next job interview on friday but I believe it helps me in future.
