title: Initial blog post
---

While studying software development, I always found blog posts most educative
sources. More experienced software engineers are posting their thoughts about
issues related their works. They give examples, which you can try yourself and
learn. Many times they point out things that you wouldn't have considered.

I am quite far from being experienced code writer. And I do not have experience
on writing blogs but one got to begin from somewhere. My main motivation to
create this blog is to help me to find a job. Therefore, I am going to write
about software development. About issues I encounter during my working days.
Another motivator is to keep my friends up to date what I am doing and where I
am going. The blog will be diveded into two separate categories, professional and
non-professional.

Hopefully people find my blog interestining and maybe my future employer notice
that I am one who they want to hire.
