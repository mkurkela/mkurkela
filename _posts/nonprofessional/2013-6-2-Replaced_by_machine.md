title: Replaced by a machine
---

I read a column from
[techcrunch.com](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/01/after-your-job-is-gone/) about
how technology is destroying jobs more than it creates. The column gives quite
frightening picture of future where gap between poor and rich is becoming wider
and wider and majority would belong into group of poor, while leaving no middle
class at all. Unfortunatly scenario is true in many places in the world already
but is it the way we in developed countries are also going?

The column correctly pointed out that the machine that replaces the worker is
able to generate more wealth and therefore the resources we have to divide
between us all grows bigger. The point is how do we share the wealth. Current
monetary system we are having is very unequal and would lead the scenario the
column describes.

In Finland we have traditionally had very low cap between poor and rich and we
still have it relatively low when we are comparing to rest of the world. The
politic we have been pursued last decades is widening the cap. Of course the
steps we have took in politics have been done to maintain our competitiveness.
However, these steps has increased unequality, in contexst of wealth. The
monetary system we are having right now has inbuilt feature of bankruptcy. All
money is depth and all depth has interest rate, which leads that more and more
depth got to be taken all the time. The system worked quite well for while but
now the amount of the depth is so high that we basically can not create
enough new depth to cover the interest rates of old ones and the system is
collapsing.

The destruction of the monetary system is not necessarily bad thing. Even
without the monetary system we are able to produce same amount of products. Food
can be produced, factories supply us the same amount of stuff. Money was the mean to
divide the products. It did it unequally. Now we are soon having a change to
create a better system. It will not be easy task and ones that were getting
advantage of the old system will resist the change. The change will be
dramatic and unfortunately there will be riots and blood.

I began the post by telling that machines replace people at work places. They do, but
they are able to generate more wealth and resources for us. It is up to us how
we share the wealth. I want to be an optimistic and hope that we can create
something better. The first wave of riots has began. I mean the occopy movement
and other recent riots in because of social unequality and also the arab
spring. The solution can be got only together. The European Union and the United
Nations could be the force that can make the difference. Unfortunatly, because
of the bad times, many look into past and think that they could bring back the
world gone decades ago. But that world is gone and future is global so lets
build better future together.
